# PI-Detector

Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range of applications, including safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences. Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether a given input could produce such errors.  Researchers tend to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1) difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives, operates at a considerably slower speed.

To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to detect large floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate floating-point error computation.

## Option
```
Usage: detector [--help] [--version] [--relerr] [--derivatives] lib mode input output

Positional arguments:
  lib            Specify the library to use (gsl/hsed/matrix) [required]
  mode           Specify the mode (input/matrix) [required]
  input          Specify the input file path [required]
  output         Specify the output file path [required]

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help     shows help message and exits 
  -v, --version  prints version information and exits 
  --relerr       Calculate relative error instead of ulp error 
  --derivatives  Compute numerical derivatives and backward errors (only with --relerr)
```

**Note**: Backward errors are calculated as `relative_error / condition_number` and are only computed when both `--relerr` and `--derivatives` flags are used.
